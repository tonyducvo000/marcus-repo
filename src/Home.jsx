                            <p>The MARCUS Literacy Project, Inc. exists to change the arch of the student experience in the American education system by eradicating childhood illiteracy by 2050. Our vision is that every student who graduates from a US public school
                                will have the literacy skills required to approach life with joy, confidence, and dignity.</p>
                            <p>According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, 65% of fourth-grade students and 66% of eighth-grade students cannot read proficiently. Overall, progress in reading has not progressed in over a decade with the nation’s highest
                                achievers stagnating and lowest performers falling further and further behind.</p>
                            <p>Evidence-based intervention in the early grades demonstrates that students can become proficient readers, providing the necessary foundation for continued learning throughout thier middle, high school, and professional careers.</p>
                            <p>We know the deleterious effects of illiteracy, and if current trends continue, 83% of students who cannot read proficiently by 3rd grade are at increased risk of dropping out of high school, are twice as likely to be unemployed, are more
                                likely to experience poor health outcomes, and have higher rates of involvement in the criminal justice system.</p>
